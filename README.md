# SpanishULMFit
This repository contains implementations of [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) by Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder applied to NLP tasks for the Spanish Language.

This approach achieves SOTA in the GeneralTASS Dataset (the test set was not available so a part of the training set was kept separate for testing).
